## Description
This repository contains a homework assignment dedicated to linear regression and its implementation from scratch using Python.

The goal of the project is to predict house prices based on selected features and to demonstrate different approaches to finding the optimal model parameters:
- gradient descent,
- analytical (normal equation) solution,
- built-in implementation from scikit-learn for validation.

## Technologies
- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## Functionality
- Implementation of the linear regression hypothesis function in vectorized form
- Implementation of the loss function in vectorized form
- Implementation of a single step of gradient descent
- Feature selection and data preprocessing
- Feature normalization using StandardScaler
- Training a linear regression model using gradient descent
- Finding optimal model parameters using:
  - gradient descent
  - analytical solution (normal equation)
- Validation of results using LinearRegression from scikit-learn
- Comparison of parameters obtained by different methods

The model predicts house prices based on:
- area
- number of bathrooms
- number of bedrooms
